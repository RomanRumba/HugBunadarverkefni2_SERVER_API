# File Server extensions for Very Wow Chat server




## Server side

Let's say it would be possible to upload a file via URL,

`https://verywowch.at/upload`

## Client side


## Worries

* Can anybody upload files to our server?
    * If not, does the user upload a file as a user, or does the user upload the file to a chat room?
        * My question here is, should it only be possible to upload files/images through chat rooms?
* If somebody manages to create a "malicious" chat message which includes the URL to some resource, e.g. an image, that was never posted to this chat room, should other users be able to view that resource?
* Can anyone view resources?
